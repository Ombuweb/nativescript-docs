= Webpack API

== API

=== webpack.init(env: IWebpackEnv)

*Required*: initialize the internal `env` object that's used throughout the config building process.

The passed env should be an object containing key-value pairs.
This is generally handled by webpack.

=== webpack.useConfig(config: string | false)

_Optional_: specify base config - defaults to auto-discovery.

Passing `false` will opt out from using a base config; however, this is generally never recommended.

=== webpack.chainWebpack(chainFn, options?)

_Optional_: add a new `chainFn` to the internal chain that will be called while resolving the final config.

The `chainFn` should be a function that accepts 2 parameters &mdash;
`config` and `env`.

The `options` is an optional object with the following optional properties:

* `order: number`: controls the order in which the `chainFn` should be applied.
+
Useful when related plugins rely on changes made in the right order.
For example, `plugin1` can specify `order: 1` and `plugin2` can specify `order: 2` - this will guarantee that ``plugin1``'s `chainFn` is called first, and that `plugin2` can rely on values set by `plugin1`.

*Example: Force production mode*

[,js]
----
webpack.chainWebpack((config, env) => {
  config.mode('production')
})
----

*Example: Run a config "last"*

Setting `order: 10` doesn't necessarily guarantee the `chainFn` will be applied last, since other calls to `chainWebpack` could specify a higher number.
We recommend against setting higher values, and using `10` as a conventional "last".

[,js]
----
webpack.chainWebpack(
  (config, env) => {
    config.set('somethingThatShouldBeSetLast', true)
  },
  { order: 10 }
)
----

=== webpack.mergeWebpack(mergeFnOrObject)

_Optional_: merges an object (or an object returned by a function) into the resolved chain config.

*Example*

[,js]
----
// merge an object into the internal config
webpack.mergeWebpack({
  something: true
})
// or pass a function that returns an object
webpack.mergeWebpack(env => {
  return {
    something: true
  }
})
----

=== webpack.resolveChainableConfig()

Resolve a new instance of the internal chain config with all chain functions applied.

=== webpack.resolveConfig()

Resolve a "final" configuration that has all chain functions and merges applied.

This returns a config that webpack can process.
