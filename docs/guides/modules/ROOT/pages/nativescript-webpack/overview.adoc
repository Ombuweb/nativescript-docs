[NOTE]
====
This section is only applicable to `@nativescript/webpack` version `5.0.0` and above.
If you are using an older version, consider upgrading.
This is compatible with a Webpack version 5.x.

All NativeScript applications are bundled using webpack.
To manage the required configuration, we maintain the `@nativescript/webpack` package.

All new projects come with the base `webpack.config.js` that's pre-configured to build a NativeScript app:

[,js]
----
const webpack = require('@nativescript/webpack')

module.exports = env => {
  webpack.init(env)

  // Learn how to customize:
  // https://docs.nativescript.org/webpack

  return webpack.resolveConfig()
}
----

The above config configures most things required to bundle a NativeScript application.
Internally, it's using a https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain[webpack-chain] to generate the final config that is passed to webpack.

In some cases, you may wish to extend the configuration, which is possible using the xref:guides::nativescript-webpack/api.adoc[API] for applications, and the xref:guides::nativescript-webpack/plugin-api.adoc[Plugin API] for plugins.
This page contains many examples of common things you might want to change in the xref:guides::nativescript-webpack/examples-of-configurations.adoc[Examples of Configurations Section] â€” for anything else not mentioned here, refer to the https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain[webpack-chain documentation].
