= Global "magic" variables

== Global "magic" variables

We define a few useful globally available variables:

* `__DEV__` — true when webpack is building in development mode
+
[,ts]
----
if (__DEV__) {
  // we are running a dev build
}
----

* `global.isAndroid`, `__ANDROID__` — true when the platform is Android
+
[,ts]
----
if (global.isAndroid) {
  // we are running on android
}
----

* `global.isIOS`, `__IOS__` — true when the platform is iOS
+
[,ts]
----
if (global.isIOS) {
  // we are running on iOS
}
----

.The following variables are also defined but are primarily intended to be used by NativeScript Core internally, or plugins that wish to use these.

====
* `__NS_WEBPACK__` — always `true` when building with webpack
* `__NS_ENV_VERBOSE__` — `true` when `--env.verbose` is set
* `__NS_DEV_HOST_IPS__` — an array of IP addresses of the host machine (the machine running the build) when in development mode, and an empty array in production mode.
* `__CSS_PARSER__` — the css parser used by NativeScript Core. The value is set based on the cssParser value in the `nativescript.config.ts` and defaults to `css-tree`
* `__UI_USE_XML_PARSER__` — a flag used by NativeScript Core to disable the XML parser when it's not used
* `__UI_USE_EXTERNAL_RENDERER__` — a flag used by NativeScript Core to disable registering global modules when an external renderer is used.
