== Webpack

[NOTE]
====
This section is only aplicable to `@nativescript/webpack` version `5.0.0` and above.
If you are using an older version, consider upgrading.
This is compatible with webpack version 5.x.
====

All NativeScript applications are bundled using webpack.
To manage the required configuration, we maintain the `@nativescript/webpack` package.

All new projects come with the base `webpack.config.js` that's pre-configured to build a NativeScript app:

[,js]
----
const webpack = require('@nativescript/webpack')

module.exports = env => {
  webpack.init(env)

  // Learn how to customize:
  // https://docs.nativescript.org/webpack

  return webpack.resolveConfig()
}
----

The above config configures most things required to bundle a NativeScript application.
Internally it's using https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain[webpack-chain] to generate the final config that is passed to webpack.

In some cases you may wish to extend the configuration, which is possible using the <<api,API>> for applications, and the <<plugin-api,Plugin API>> for plugins.
This page contains many examples of common things you might want to change in the <<examples-of-configurations,Examples of configurations section>> - for anything else not mentioned here, refer to the https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain[webpack-chain documentation].
