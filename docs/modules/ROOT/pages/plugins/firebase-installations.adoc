== What does it do

The Firebase installations service:

* provides a unique identifier for a Firebase installation
* provides an auth token for a Firebase installation
* provides an API to perform GDPR-compliant deletion of a Firebase installation.
Each configured FirebaseApp has a corresponding single instance of Installations. An instance of the class provides access to the installation info for the FirebaseApp as well as the ability to delete it. A Firebase Installation is unique by FirebaseApp.name and FirebaseApp.options.googleAppID
