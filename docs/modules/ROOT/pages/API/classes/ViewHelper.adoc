[#resolvesizeandstate]
=== resolveSizeAndState

▸ `Static` *resolveSizeAndState*(`size`, `specSize`, `specMode`, `childMeasuredState`): `number`

Utility to reconcile a desired size and state, with constraints imposed by a MeasureSpec.
Will take the desired size, unless a different size is imposed by the constraints.
The returned value is a compound integer, with the resolved size in the MEASURED_SIZE_MASK bits and optionally the bit MEASURED_STATE_TOO_SMALL set if the resulting size is smaller than the size the view wants to be.

| `size`
| `number`

| `specSize`
| `number`

| `specMode`
| `number`

| `childMeasuredState`
| `number`
